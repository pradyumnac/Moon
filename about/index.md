## About Me
Hola, dear visitor. I am Pradyumna, a Freelance Devops Engineer working on Python Stack. I am currently living in Kolkata. 

I love working on solution oriented future based technologies like **Blockchain** and **Machine Learning**. I am currently in the process of learnign **Deep-Learning myself** but I do have some experience in Non-Determisitic Algorithm implementation during my **Graduation project on Machine Vision**.

As personal projects, I have written a couple of page scrappers, Movies catalogers, Personal Portfolio Management solutions that I use daily

## What I have worked on 
* **Python** Web Developement (Django & Flask)
* **UFT & Selenium Automation** solutions (For a US based Insurance Giant)
* **Machine Learning** (Deep learning & Support Vector Machines algorithms)
* **Full Stack Developement** (Python/Java, ORM, Postgres, Javascript)
* Devops Consulting on Emerging technologies including **Docker** & **Automated Quality Assurance on Cloud** (Selenium Grid)
* **Google App Engine** (Over the course, I found that the Google Stack is the cheapest way to host your scalable projects on the cloud - be it personal or enterprise projects)
* Static Site Hosting using **Jekyll & Github Pages**

## What I work on when I am not working (Pun Intended :) )
* Electronics Product Design and DIY Hobby projects  
Though I have currently worked on hobby Projects in **Arduino**, **ESP8266(ARM)** and **RaspberryPi** and sensory networks, I plan to work on more of embedded projects. I am interested in Automating my Home and will present on this more on my blog  
* Trekking  
Trekking in the himalayas is one of my favourite activities: I feel my full self while trekking. 
I have been to **Har-Ki-Doon valley** in Sankri District of Uttaranchal. This is based on the foothills of the Mystic Swargarohini ranges.  
I also went for **Dhotrey - Sandakphu trek** where you get to see the entire Everest family as well as Kanchendzonga family in a panoramic view. The trek is set on a very beautiful track surrounded by Rhododendrons. If you ever visist this place in Arpil, you will find the valley changes colors in just a matter of weeks.  
This year in January 2017, me and a couple of my friends went to **Yuksom-Dzongri trek**. It is on the west side fo teh Sikkim state. The place is a part of the track towars the famous **Goecheala pass**. In winter, the track was so much snow cladded that we could only venture out till Phedang - one stop short till Dzongri.  
* Violin Playing  
I have just started on with this - a few months but I love the In-The-Moment feeling while I fiddle. Not much here but I will add a couple of my soundlcoud recordings here once I upload them .
* Language Learning  
I have started of with Spanish & German as of now. I love learning languages as It gives us an insight of their underlying culture. During my trekking times, I have also picked up a bit of Nepali while conversing with the locals

## My Blogs
I currently write for the following sites:  
* **On Two Feet** - A blog to docuemnt travel and backpacking related topics  
* **The Next Wave** - A blog discussing emerging technologies in very simple languages  
* **My Personal Blog** - hosted here where I rant about anything and everything (Books, Movies, thoughts, projects, productivity and most important rants )
