"Want some candy?" Said I, reaching into my pocket - my hand brushing against a cold wrapped lollipop.

She took it from my hand, without a word. We are stolling, rather slowly in the rain towards the establishment that might just get her to her parents. 

The modern lamps with spiral of led strips are ablaze - a recent development in the missing story of the city's planned urbanisation. How unreal they look - three strands of metal with a glowing head each asking grace from someone above. This part of the city has become relatively clean if you can pardon the accumulated water - no more floating plastic wrappers around. She tucked in the wrapper in my windshell jacket, I noticed from the corner of the eye..
She seemed a bit too tired though rather happy with the snail like oace we are strolling. I wondered should I lift her up in my arms and a moment later thought against it. She seems to notice each step she take rather finding herself in the moment. Or was It me who was doing the same and projecting that onto her?

We reached the station - rather alive in lights as if an establishment that never sleeps. 

A couple of Jeep's like on their back at one side by the door, all to close to the building. Perhaps someone does not like getting wet after all
